		<h2>Wolfkop camping village</h2>
		<p>A collection of camping villages on the banks of the Olifants River,
			surrounded by lush green lawns and mountainous terrain. Whatâ€™s more,
			the tents are erected on your behalf, saving you the trouble of lugging
			around heavy camping gear and making for a more comfortable camping adventure
			that borders on glamping.</p>
